                    Climate is the average weather in a place over many years. Climate change is a shift in those average conditions.
                    The rapid climate change we are now seeing is caused by humans using oil, gas and coal for their homes, factories and transport.
                    When these fossil fuels burn, they releases greenhouse gases - mostly carbon dioxide (CO2). These gases trap the Sun's heat and cause the planet's temperature to rise.
                    The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has risen by 50%.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                Temperature rises must slow down if we want to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, scientists say. They say global warming needs to be kept to 1.5C by 2100.
                However, unless further action is taken, the planet could still warm by more than 2C by the end of this century.
                If nothing is done, scientists think global warming could exceed 4C, leading to devastating heatwaves, millions losing their homes to rising sea levels and irreversible loss of plant and animal species.

                Extreme weather events are already more intense, threatening lives and livelihoods.
                With further warming, some regions could become uninhabitable, as farmland turns into desert. In other regions, 
                the opposite is happening, with extreme rainfall causing historic flooding - as seen recently in China, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands.
                People in poorer countries will suffer the most as they do not have the money to adapt to climate change. Many farms in developing countries 
                already have to endure climates that are too hot and this will only get worse.

                    Our oceans and its habitats are also under threat. The Great Barrier Reef in Australia, for example, has already lost half of its
                     corals since 1995 due to warmer seas driven by climate change.
                    Wildfires are becoming more frequent as climate change increases the risk of hot, dry weather.
                    And as frozen ground melts in places like Siberia, greenhouse gases trapped for centuries will be released into the atmosphere, worsening 
                    climate change.
                    In a warmer world, animals will find it harder to find the food and water they need to live. For example, polar bears could die out as the ice they rely on melts away, and elephants will struggle to find the 150-300 litres of water a day they need.

                    Countries agree climate change can only be tackled by working together, and in a landmark agreement in Paris in 2015, they pledged to try to keep
                     global warming to 1.5C.The UK is hosting a summit for world leaders, called COP26, in November, where countries will set out their carbon reduction
                     plans for 2030.
                    Many countries have pledged to get to net zero by 2050. This means reducing greenhouse gas emissions as much as possible and balancing out remaining 
                    emissions by absorbing an equivalent amount from the atmosphere.
                    Experts agree that this is achievable, but it will require governments, businesses and individuals to make big changes.
